# Baruch Python Summer 2017 Programming Project 1

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Baruch-LP/su17_python_assign01.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Baruch-LP/su17_python_assign01)

## Task 1
Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers.

Using the three numbers from the user, find the sum, average, and product.

## Task 2
Write a program that asks the user two questions such as their name, age, favorite TV show, etc.
Create a simple dialogue using the information gathered such as:
Hi, John!
I heard you liked Shark Tank a lot. There's a new episode this week.

## Task 3
Create a program that asks the user whether it is raining, snowing, windy or sunny outside. Using conditional statements, determine what you will say to the user using the *print* function. Your output could look something like this:

Is it rainy, windy, snowing, or sunny out today?
> rainy

*Woah, better bring an umbrella then!*

OR

Is it rainy, windy, snowing, or sunny out today?
> sunny

*Well, enjoy the day!*

Make sure that you also have an *else* case with an appropriate output.
